# Changelog

## Unreleased
- Added a `separator` parameter to `to_lists` and `to_dicts` as a way of specifying
  non-standard CSV field separators.
- Added a `FieldSeparator` type to specify common field separators.

## v3.0.2 - 8 January 2025
- Dependency requirement for `glearray` has been relaxed to permit v1 or v2.

## v3.0.1 - 13 November 2024
- `from_lists` and consequently `from_dicts` now append a line ending to the end

## v3.0.0 - 4 November 2024
- Improved performance of `to_lists`, `to_dicts`, `from_lists` and `from_lists`.

  of a `String`.
